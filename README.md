# SkillPath Journal

SkillPath Journal is a web application for organizing learning tracks and logging study sessions.  
It helps track progress, total study time, and keeps data stored locally in the browser.

Live Demo: https://study-track-manager.netlify.app

Note: The app uses localStorage, so it will be empty on first visit. Add a few tracks and sessions to see how it works.
